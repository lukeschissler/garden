## Usage

Add plants to your garden by clicking the sprout icon in the left column titled "Plants". You can also search for specific plants. Plant instances will be 
added to the middle column titled "Garden." 

For each plant you can:
  1. Update when it was watered by clicking the watering can icon.
  2. Harvest from the plant by clicking the scythe icon.
  3. Add details to the plant by clicking the wheelbarrow icon.
  4. Remove the plant by clicking the shovel icon.
  
The hose button will water all plants in your garden, and the tractor button will remove all plants from your garden. 

Harvests for each plant type are kept in the column titled "Harvests," and includes dynamic icons based on the number of harvests from that plant type.

Your garden is kept in local storage, and will be persistant between browser sessions.
